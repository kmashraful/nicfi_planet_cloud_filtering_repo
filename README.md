# nicfi_planet_cloud_filtering_repo
Reproducible cloud and haze filtering for Planet-NICFI basemaps on Google Earth Engine. Implements two simple, training-free algorithms — a conservative Blue–NIR threshold and a Sentinel-2–derived adaptive statistical filter — for large-scale tropical monitoring and operational use.
